# Popping and Locking - Darker

This theme is designed to have vivid colors, capture your attention and be pleasing to look at all day. 
According to its originator [Hedinn Eriksson](https://github.com/hedinne), he derived the Popping and Locking color scheme from these other themes: VS Dark+, Gruvbox Dark and One Dark.

For a higher contrast I adjusted the background color to be a bit darker than in the original.
